## Project #2 Investigate a TMDB-MOVIES Dataset

### Introduction
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is. The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.


### Objective
As a moviegoer, I am not only getting hocked by the story line, cinematography and cast performance of a movie but also I would like to pay more attention to define a successful movie in terms of commercial aspect. Because there will be no one want to invest in a film production without getting a clear picture of how profitable it would be as launching them out aka Return of investment (ROI). Based on that, we may find features that can partially relate to its economic success in this dataset. The final objective is finding aspects to make the next blockbuster movie which is substantially profitable.
